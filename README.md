# WooCommerce Store – WordPress

A portfolio-ready WooCommerce store project being built step by step with WordPress, WooCommerce, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub.

## Current Status

- Scope 1: Environment Setup — completed
- Scope 2: Project Initialization — completed
- Scope 3: Store Requirements & Architecture — completed
- Scope 4: Theme & Design System — completed
- Scope 5: WooCommerce Foundation — completed

The project blueprint is documented in [Store Requirements & Architecture](docs/store-requirements-architecture.md). The locked concept is **DeskNest** — a Germany-first desk-setup and workspace accessories WooCommerce store concept.

The DeskNest theme and design-system blueprint is documented in [Theme & Design System](docs/theme-design-system.md). The selected direction is a custom DeskNest block-theme architecture using `theme.json`, native templates, reusable patterns, centralized design tokens, and minimal JavaScript.

The WooCommerce foundation baseline — installation, Germany/EUR settings, default pages, and validation — is documented in [WooCommerce Foundation](docs/woocommerce-foundation.md). This is a foundation baseline only: no products, taxes, payments, shipping, or custom storefront UI have been configured yet.

Scopes 3 and 4 cover documentation and planning only. No custom theme folder has been created or activated. Scope 5 installed and configured WooCommerce's foundation settings only; no products, taxes, payments, shipping, or storefront implementation has started yet.

## Repository Notes

WordPress core, `wp-config.php`, uploads, logs, LocalWP runtime files, and generated files are intentionally ignored. Custom theme and plugin folders will be explicitly tracked later, only when their respective development scopes begin.

The Git repository is initialized on `main`, the baseline files are committed, the GitHub remote is connected, and `main` has been pushed to `origin/main`.

## Scope Boundaries

This repository currently documents the initialized LocalWP WordPress project, the theme and design-system blueprint, and the WooCommerce foundation baseline (Germany/EUR settings and default pages only). Products, cart, checkout, customer accounts, payments, shipping, and the custom storefront theme will be handled in later scopes.

## Local Setup

1. Open the site through LocalWP.
2. Start the LocalWP site before opening `woocommerce-store-wordpress.local`.
3. Do not commit real secrets or `wp-config.php`.

## Current Limitations

- No WooCommerce store functionality has been implemented yet.
- No custom theme has been selected or built yet.
- No production deployment exists yet.
